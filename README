OBSOLETE - Migrated to Ubiquitous Bash, part of audioManager.

__Purpose__
Preprocesses audio files with reverberation, headphone frequency response correction, and other effects. Once preprocessed, these audio files may be used on embedded devices (eg. smartphones) without real-time LADSPA capability.

__Usage__
Settings for the headphone frequency parametric equalizers may be roughly determined manually using audacious with a frequency sweep audio file. Adjust for constant amplitude across all frequencies, then adjust script values to match the resulting configuration in ~/.config/audacious/config . Obviously, a calibrated microphone greatly eases the process.

Depends on multiport LADSPA capable version of SOX (see: http://sourceforge.net/p/sox/patches/92/ ).
